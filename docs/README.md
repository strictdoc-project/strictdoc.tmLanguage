# Documentation

This folder contains internal project documentation for contributors and maintainers.

## Contents

- `publishing.md`: Instructions for building and publishing the VS Code extension
- `contributing.md`: Notes for contributors
- `examples/`: Example documents and screenshots for testing and demonstration

> Avoid putting user-facing documentation in this folder. Use the main `README.md` for that.
