# Committer Guidelines

Hi! Thanks for contributing 🤝
Just a couple of notes to keep things clean and consistent:

## Dev/Test files

✅ When adding development or test files, update `.vscodeignore` accordingly — exclude anything not required in the final `.vsix` package.
Use the dedicated section at the bottom of `.vscodeignore` if unsure where a file belongs.
